# tf-module-openstack-base

This repository contains foundational Terraform modules for provisioning core infrastructure components on OpenStack. These modules abstract common OpenStack resources, providing a standardized way to deploy base networking, compute, and storage elements.

## Key Features and Structure:

*   **OpenStack Resource Management**: Provides Terraform resources for managing OpenStack services like compute instances, networks, security groups, and volumes.
*   **Modular Design**: Offers reusable components that can be composed to build more complex infrastructure.
*   **Standardization**: Enforces consistent deployment patterns for OpenStack resources.

## Role in CyberRangeCZ:

The `tf-module-openstack-base` repository is essential for establishing the underlying infrastructure on OpenStack. It enables the efficient and consistent deployment of resources that form the foundation for other services and applications within the CyberRangeCZ platform.
