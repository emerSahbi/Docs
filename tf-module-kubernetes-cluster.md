# tf-module-kubernetes-cluster

This repository contains Terraform modules designed for provisioning and managing Kubernetes clusters. These modules abstract the complexity of setting up Kubernetes, whether on cloud providers or on-premises, enabling declarative management of cluster infrastructure.

## Key Features and Structure:

*   **Kubernetes Cluster Provisioning**: Provides resources for creating and configuring Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Cloud Provider Integration**: Supports deployment across various cloud platforms (e.g., AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE) or on-premises.
*   **Cluster Configuration**: Allows for the definition of node pools, networking, storage, and other cluster settings.
*   **Infrastructure as Code**: Enables Kubernetes cluster management through declarative Terraform configurations.

## Role in CyberRangeCZ:

The `tf-module-kubernetes-cluster` repository is fundamental for deploying and managing containerized applications within the CyberRangeCZ platform. It ensures that scalable and reliable Kubernetes infrastructure can be provisioned and managed efficiently using Terraform.
