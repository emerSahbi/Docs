# tf-module-images

This repository contains Terraform modules designed for managing Docker images as part of infrastructure deployments. These modules likely facilitate the pulling, building, or deploying of container images within cloud environments or Kubernetes clusters.

## Key Features and Structure:

*   **Image Management**: Provides Terraform resources for interacting with container registries or image build processes.
*   **Infrastructure Integration**: Links Docker image deployment with the broader infrastructure defined by Terraform.
*   **Container Orchestration**: May include modules to deploy containers based on specific images to orchestration platforms.

## Role in CyberRangeCZ:

The `tf-module-images` repository streamlines the process of integrating containerized applications into the CyberRangeCZ platform's infrastructure. It ensures that Docker images are managed efficiently and reliably as part of the overall deployment strategy.
