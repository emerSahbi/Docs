# devops-mkdocs-swagger-ui-plugin

**Note: This repository is no longer active. Its functionality has been superseded by an official Swagger plugin for MkDocs.**

This repository previously contained a custom **MkDocs plugin** designed to integrate interactive Swagger UI (for OpenAPI specifications) directly into documentation generated by MkDocs. Its purpose was to provide a seamless and user-friendly way to display API documentation alongside other project documentation for the CyberRangeCZ platform.

## Historical Functionality:

*   **Swagger UI Integration**: The plugin allowed developers to embed a fully functional Swagger UI console within their MkDocs-generated documentation.
*   **YAML Specification Support**: It rendered API documentation from YAML-formatted OpenAPI specifications.
*   **Documentation Workflow Enhancement**: By integrating API documentation directly into the MkDocs build process, it ensured that the technical documentation remained consistent and easily accessible.
*   **Customization**: The `README.md` described how to install the plugin and configure `mkdocs.yaml` to point to the OpenAPI specification files (expected in `/docs/reference/`).

## Role in CyberRangeCZ (Historical Context):

Historically, this plugin played an important role in the DevOps and documentation strategy of the CyberRangeCZ platform by:

*   **Centralizing Documentation**: Providing a single portal for both general project documentation and detailed API specifications.
*   **Improving Developer Experience**: Making it easier for developers and integrators to understand and use the APIs exposed by the platform's microservices.
*   **Automating API Docs**: Facilitating the automation of API documentation generation and presentation, reducing manual effort and potential for outdated information.

Although now deprecated in favor of an official solution, this repository represents an early effort to integrate advanced documentation features into the CyberRangeCZ ecosystem, reflecting a commitment to comprehensive and accessible technical information.
