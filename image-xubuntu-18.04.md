This repository defines a Docker image based on Xubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver). Xubuntu is a lighter-weight derivative of Ubuntu, known for its use of the Xfce desktop environment, offering a more resource-efficient graphical environment. This image is suitable for tasks requiring a graphical Linux environment that is less resource-intensive than standard Ubuntu.

## Key Features and Structure:

*   **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions for building the Xubuntu 18.04 LTS Docker image.
*   **Base OS**: Utilizes Xubuntu 18.04 LTS, providing a stable Linux environment with the Xfce desktop.
*   **Lightweight GUI**: Offers a graphical user interface that is suitable for development, testing, or applications that benefit from a GUI but have limited resources.

## Role in CyberRangeCZ:

The `image-xubuntu-18.04` repository provides a stable, graphical Linux environment that is lighter on resources than a full Ubuntu desktop. This is beneficial for development or testing workflows that require a GUI but operate in resource-constrained environments within the CyberRangeCZ platform.
