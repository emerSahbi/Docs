# terraform-testing-definition

This repository defines the testing strategies, configurations, and potentially the infrastructure required for validating Terraform code used within the CyberRangeCZ project. It aims to ensure the reliability and correctness of infrastructure deployments managed by Terraform.

## Key Features and Structure:

*   **Test Frameworks**: May include configurations for integration testing, end-to-end testing, or policy-as-code validation of Terraform modules.
*   **Testing Environment Setup**: Could define the infrastructure needed to run these tests in an isolated environment.
*   **Validation Standards**: Establishes criteria and methodologies for validating Terraform code.

## Role in CyberRangeCZ:

The `terraform-testing-definition` repository is crucial for ensuring the quality and stability of infrastructure managed by Terraform. By formalizing testing procedures, it helps prevent configuration errors and ensures that deployments are robust and reliable.
