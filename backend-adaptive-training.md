# backend-adaptive-training

This repository contains the "CyberRangeCZ Platform Adaptive Training" backend microservice, which serves as the central component for managing and orchestrating adaptive training paths within the CyberRangeCZ platform. It defines the core logic, data models, and processes that enable the platform to offer personalized training experiences, dynamically adjusting to trainee performance and progress.

## Key Technologies and Features:

*   **Java with Spring Boot**: Built using Java and the Spring Boot framework, providing a scalable and efficient environment for backend services.
*   **Comprehensive Data Management**:
    *   **Spring Data JPA**: For managing persistent data related to adaptive training (e.g., training definitions, trainee progress, adaptive states).
    *   **QueryDSL**: Enables the construction of type-safe and powerful queries, suggesting complex data retrieval and manipulation logic crucial for adaptive learning algorithms.
    *   **Flyway**: Manages database schema migrations, ensuring smooth updates and consistency across different environments.
    *   **H2 Database / PostgreSQL**: Supports both in-memory H2 (for development/testing) and PostgreSQL (for production) as database backends.
*   **RESTful API**: Provides a well-defined RESTful API at `/adaptive-training/api/v1` for interaction with other services and the frontend, with documentation generated by Swagger/Springfox.
*   **Internal Service Dependencies**: Integrates with other core CyberRangeCZ services:
    *   `crczp-security-commons`: Suggests a reliance on a shared security framework for authentication and authorization.
    *   `crczp-elasticsearch-documents`: Indicates that adaptive training data or related events are stored or queried from Elasticsearch, likely for analytics, search, or historical tracking.
*   **Dynamic JSON Filtering**: Utilizes `Squiggly Filter Jackson` for dynamic filtering of JSON responses, allowing clients to request only the data they need.
*   **Caching Mechanisms**: Incorporates `Spring Boot Starter Cache` to improve performance by caching frequently accessed data.
*   **High Code Quality**: Adheres to strict code quality and security standards, integrating tools like Spotless, Surefire, Checkstyle, SpotBugs, and OWASP Dependency-Check in its build process.
*   **Containerization**: Includes a `Dockerfile` for easy deployment as a Docker container within the platform's microservices architecture.

## Role in CyberRangeCZ:

The `backend-adaptive-training` service is central to the platform's ability to deliver intelligent and tailored cybersecurity education. It performs critical functions such as:

*   **Defining Adaptive Paths**: Stores and manages the logic for how training scenarios should adapt based on trainee input and outcomes.
*   **Tracking Trainee Progress**: Records and processes detailed data about a trainee's performance, skill acquisition, and interaction with the training environment.
*   **Orchestrating Adaptive Flow**: Collaborates with services like `backend-adaptive-smart-assistant` to dynamically adjust the difficulty, provide hints, or branch trainees to different learning modules.
*   **Supporting Analytics**: Its integration with Elasticsearch suggests capabilities for deep analysis of training effectiveness and patterns.

This service is key to enabling a truly adaptive, engaging, and effective learning experience in the CyberRangeCZ environment.
