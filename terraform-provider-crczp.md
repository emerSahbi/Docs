## Key Features and Structure:

*   **Custom Terraform Provider**: Implements the Terraform plugin interface to manage CyberRangeCZ resources.
*   **Resource Management**: Enables the declarative management of CyberRangeCZ entities through Terraform.
*   **IaC Integration**: Integrates CyberRangeCZ resource management into a broader Terraform-based infrastructure management strategy.

## Role in CyberRangeCZ:

The `terraform-provider-crczp` repository is essential for enabling unified infrastructure management. It allows for the programmatic creation, configuration, and lifecycle management of CyberRangeCZ platform components using Terraform, streamlining operations and ensuring consistency.
