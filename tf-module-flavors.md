# tf-module-flavors

This repository contains a collection of reusable Terraform modules that define various "flavors" or deployment configurations. These modules abstract common infrastructure patterns, allowing for easy customization and deployment of different application stacks or environment types.

## Key Features and Structure:

*   **Reusable Terraform Modules**: Provides modular components for defining infrastructure.
*   **Deployment Flavors**: Offers pre-defined configurations for common deployment scenarios (e.g., specific database setups, web server configurations).
*   **Parameterization**: Modules are designed to be parameterized, allowing for flexible customization of deployed resources.

## Role in CyberRangeCZ:

The `tf-module-flavors` repository promotes consistency and reusability in infrastructure deployment. By providing curated modules for different deployment scenarios, it simplifies the process of setting up and managing various components of the CyberRangeCZ platform.
